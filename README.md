# idlegame
my javascript idlegame
working on making my first own project in javascript.
I enjoy idle games a fair bit and i thought why not make one.
Right now i have some ideas planned out like adding more "Upgrades" and maybe a "prestige" system that lets the user restart the game but get upgrades depending on how far they got.
Later looking to make it look nice with css and some proper html
